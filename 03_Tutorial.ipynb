In many programming languages, when dividing numbers, the result contains a decimal only if the original data type contains a decimal. For example, in strongly typed languages like C++ and C#, if you start with integer values, then the result leaves out the decimal place. Python does not behave this way. Since data type is inferred, Python will avoid rounding and return a value with the decimal."

    "Now let's discuss conditional statements. At a basic level, a conditional statement evaluates two possible conditions and executes code for *only one* of those conditions. There are several types of conditional statements in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description |\n",
    "|:---:|:---|\n",
    "| if | Used to check if a certain condition is true, and if so, execute a specific block of code |\n",
    "| if else | Used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false |\n",
    "| if elif | Used to check multiple conditions, and execute a specific block of code based on which condition is true |\n",
    "| nested if else | Used when we need to check a condition inside another condition |\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional statement contains several basic features:\n",
    "1. The start of the sequence.\n",
    "2. The boolean condition(s) tested (the expression).\n",
    "3. The statements following the condition.\n",
    "4. The end of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use conditional statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Adaptability*: They make your code adaptable to different situations.\n",
    "* *Control Flow*: They help control the flow of your program based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into conditional statements any further, let's discuss a data type we did not previously cover: boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in a program you will encounter the need to program in decision-making abilities. For example, if your mobile app allows food orders your program will need to decide how much to charge the customer based on the item ordered. Since a program runs sequentially (all the code is read in a programming file starting at the top and running contiguously to the bottom), you do not want the program to process each food item and charge a customer for every single item on the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "All programs rely on decision making logic. When you register for classes, the program must perform several checks in order for you to register:\n",
    "* Do you have the appropriate class standing?\n",
    "* Do you meet all the prerequisites for a course?\n",
    "* Do you have any academic violations?\n",
    "* Do you have any behavioral vioaltions?\n",
    "* Do you have any financial blocks on your account?\n",
    "* Is the class at seating capacity?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program decides you pass all the checks, then you proceed to register for your classes. All of these require decision-making logic. At the heart of this decision-making logic is the concept of boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Values\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental concepts of programming is the boolean. Boolean values are very basic compared to many other types of data. Booleans can possess one of two possible values. What are those values? In Python, those include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* True/False\n",
    "\n",
    "While booleans may seem basic compared to other types, they are used in very complex situations, such as decision making in if-statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like a light switch, booleans have two possible states. The most common states include `True` and `False`; sometimes, other programming languages use `Yes` and `No`; less commonly is `On` and `Off` (unless you design a program to interface with hardware, like the LED lights on keyboards). Another common set of states include `0` and `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-valued logic, while seeminlgy limiting, is not uncommon in our everyday life. For example, in law, the status of a defendent at the end of a trial is guilty or innocent (no in-betweens). Laws are either broken or not. When purchasing a product, you either purchased it or you did not. [Logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) in hardware are another example of a boolean state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the boolean type can only be assigned `True` or `False` like so:"

    "## Conditional Statements II\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the boolean data type we can focus on the conditional statement. Recall, a conditional statement has the following four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The start of the sequence.\n",
    "1. The boolean condition(s) tested (the expression).\n",
    "1. The statements following the condition.\n",
    "1. The end of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example of these four components. The diagram below presents a conditional statement illustrating the evaluation of a ski resort.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><center>\n",
    "<img src = \"https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/40e421a2-82e2-4e11-bae7-a5286464cab7/image.png\" width = \"300\"></center>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The start of the sequence is the arrow at the top. Usually, a conditional statement in code comes after other lines of code. The second part is the conditional expression, or boolean expression, which assesses the condition we are testing. In this case, we are testing whether or not the ski resort is open. Remember, all conditional expressions must return a boolean value. Thus, this is not evaluating *when* the ski resort will open, but if the ski resort is open. Is it true or false?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each branch of the boolean expression is the result of the evaluation being `True` or `False`. If the ski resort is open (i.e., true), then I can go skiing. If the ski resort is not open (i.e., false), then I just continue on with life, reaching the end of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "With conditional statements, the code will not run *both* branches of the condition. That is, the ski resort can not be open and closed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If and Else\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages rely on two types of conditional expressions: if-else and switch-case. Python only has if-else. If you are familiar with switch-case, you know it is just a special form of if-else. Before we jump into code, let's use pseudocode to reinforce the concepts you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the generic form of our logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If boolean_condition Then:\n",
    "   consequent\n",
    "Else:\n",
    "   alternative\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is the ski resort version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If ski resort is open Then:\n",
    "   go skiing\n",
    "Else:\n",
    "   do not go skiing\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We first evaluate the boolean expression `ski resort is open`. This expression returns a boolean value. In this situation, if the ski resort is open, then the boolean condition returns `True`. As a consequence, we `go skiing`. If the ski resort is not open, the boolean expression returns `False` and we `do not go skiing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you attempt to write a conditional statement, it is recommended that you always start with pseudocode. This forces you to think of the logic first, then the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of creating an if-statement in Python follows a simple pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # some consequent, if condition is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # alternative, if condition is false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's convert the above code into something a little more Pythonic using our ski resort example. We will first create a variable that has a value representing the status of the ski resort. The value of `1` means the ski resort is open whereas the value of `0` means that the ski resort is closed. For this example, we will set it to `1`."

    "We can work out the logic before we even start to code and create pseudocode. First, we need to identify the various features of our conditional statement. Recall, a conditional statement contains the following:\n",

    "### Jump Statements: Break and Continue\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump statements allow us to stop processing the currently executing code and leap to another section of code. These include the keywords `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `return`. While `pass` is technically classified as a jump statement, it does not behave like the other three. We will only focus on `break`, `continue`, and a little on `pass` at this moment. We will cover `return` when we discuss methods and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Break\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest sense, the `break` keyword serves as a mechanism to stop and break out of code. A simple way to view it is a `break` serves to stop further processing of code after a desired state is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective is too narrow for what `break` actually does. In actuality, *the `break` statement terminates the closest enclosing iteration or statement*. Thus, `break` can be used to stop processing any block of code such as a loop or if-statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we imported an Excel data file of customers and we create a loop to iterate over each row in the Excel file. This file contains 3,472 records. We are searching for a row that contains information on a specific customer. If the record is number 1,836 we would not want the loop to continue looping over the other 1,636 records. That would be a waste of time and compute resources. This is where the `break` statement comes to your aid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using an `if` statement, we can utilize the `break` to stop processing a loop, like so:\n",

    "    # block of code\n",
